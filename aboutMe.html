          <h1>Hi there! My name is Edy and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
          <p>After several months of starting learning how to code, I've finally
            decided to start my journey to become a Full Stack developer. Currently I'm
            focusing in learning all about the FrontEnd area, expecting to start learning 
            BackEnd right after.

        <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
        <p>
          My biggest advice to someone who's trying to learn how to code and be commited
          to it is to find a "coding partner". You'll UNDOUBTLY be more motivated to code
          and to learn if you feel that you are in a sort of "competition" with a friend
          of yours.
          <br><br>
          Also, share your work with people that you find important, it'll boost your motivation
          and you'll find yourself eager to show them your new project.
        </p>
        <h3>How I get started</h3>
        <p>
          I started learning code back in 2022 during the end of the year, learning the basics
          in Python and then learning more back at school, where I started my career as a programming
          student.
          <br>
          However, I started learning Web-Dev in 2023, when a certain opportunity to work showed
          to me, which, unfortunatly, couldn't come to a reality but at the end of the day, it started
          that desire inside me to develop in the Full Stack area with a hopeful desire to turn this 
          into my source of income and my business in the future.
